Big Data 2015 - A Study of linguistic drift - Ngrams extraction - Gil Brechb√ºhler and Malik Bougacha

This MapReduce code extracts the Ngrams from the articles and outputs them in the output folder sorted in different files by year.
Those files need to be merged before being used (there is one file by year and by reducer, MultipleOutput is used).

It takes as arguments :
        - The input directory containg the n-grams for each year
        - The output directory

A call sample :

hadoop jar Ngram.jar ch.epfl.bigdata.ngram.Ngram /projects/dh-shared/* /projects/linguistic-shift/ngrams/

(Note that the input directory is read recursively).
