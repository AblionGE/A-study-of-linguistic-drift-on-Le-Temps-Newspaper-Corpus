Big Data 2015 - A Study of linguistic drift - Statistics on punctuation computation - Gil Brechb√ºhler

This scala/spark code takes all the articles (already seprated from the XML by year, in the format article\narticle\n....)
and outputs the stats on punctuation by year (in one file, one line by year) in the following format :

year,average_commas_by_sentence,average_semicolons_by_sentence,average_colons_by_sentence

A call sample :

spark-submit --class "PunctuationStats" --master yarn-cluster --executor-memory 4g --num-executors 200 target/scala-2.10/punctuation-statistics_2.10-1.0.jar
