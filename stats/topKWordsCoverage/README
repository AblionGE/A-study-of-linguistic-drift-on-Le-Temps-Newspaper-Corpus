Big Data 2015 - A Study of linguistic drift - Coverage of top K words - Gil Brechb√ºhler

This scala/spark code takes all the 1-grams and computes the percentage of the text covered by the top k most used
1-grams. Starts registering data when the top k words have a coverage of 85% and stops at 95%. Computes this only for 4 years accross our
timeline : 1840, 1900, 1950, 1995.
