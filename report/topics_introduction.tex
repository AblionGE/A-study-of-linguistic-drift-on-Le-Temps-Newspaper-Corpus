We wanted to see how is the evolution of the language inside a specific topic of the corpus (e.g. swiss politics, sport, art,...).	
Our idea was that a topic clustering would help us capture the linguistic drift more precisely when comparing two articles that talk about the same subject.
This new approach would give us different results.\\
For topic clustering, we chose to use \emph{Latent Dirichlet Allocation} (LDA) implemented in spark since spark 1.3.0. 
The algorithms take as input a matrix of article and 1-gram occurrences and cluster the articles into a specified number \textit{n} of topics. We could also set te parameters for topic distribution over terms $\beta$ and articles distribution over topics $\alpha$. Empirical results led us to set the $\beta$ to 17, a relatively high value because articles contain lot of stop words that could have too much weight foe lower values. In the same way, we set $\alpha$ to 1.1, the minimum value, as articles in a newspaper would rather belong to a single topic. For a number of topics equal to \textit{n} equal to 20.\\
