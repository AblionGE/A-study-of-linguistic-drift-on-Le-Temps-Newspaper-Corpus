We wanted to see how is the evolution of the language inside a specific topic of the corpus (e.g. swiss politics, sport, art,...). Maybe this new approach will give us better/worst result. Nonetheless, we thought that it would have been an interesting point of view to study the linguistic drift by looking at a set of words that are similar from each others rather than everything mixed up.\\
For extract the different topics we used the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with MLlib on Spark.
