\subsection{Synonyms}

We have to remember that beyond n-gram frequency changes, there is also a shift in term of topics that are covered by newspapers over the years. To try to isolate our analysis from that effect, we planned to compare frequencies for words that have pretty similar meaning using a synonym dictionary. After trying a few of them, we have chosen to use the myThes v2.0 synonym dictionary from OpenOffice that seemed exhaustive and accurate enough. \\

Frequency vectors were generated for every entry in the synonym database (using mapReduce) before being inserted in a SQL database. We have chosen to average frequencies to ranges of 5 years such as to limit the data size. Then we build a little web app that allow to check for words in the thesaurus database, then select a subset of the proposed similar words before displaying a plot with the evolution of frequencies.\\

This interactive application enabled us to quickly explore hypothesis we had about expected frequencies changes whereas before as we would need to run a mapReduce job on the cluster for any chosen word. But most of time, the synonyms proposed happened to be have various meaning and were unsuitable to perform a automated analysis on our data. The intervention of the user was crucial during the selection phase to choose the appropriate ones. For instance a synonym for "voiture" (car) is "caisse" (slang) that also means box (by far its most frequent usage). Thus the perceived frequency of "caisse" will be strongly overstated and we cannot easily, at least for the scope of this project, tell apart the different meanings of a given 1-gram and slit the occurrences accordingly
