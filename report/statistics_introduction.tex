We have articles from two newspapers covering years 1840 to 1998. The first step we did was to extract the 1 to 5-grams. Then we could work on those grams. The grams are separated by their sizes in different folders (1-grams, 2-grams, ...) and there is one file by year in those folders. The files contain entries in the form : gram <tabulation> count. Where count is the number of time the gram appears in the year.

Know we can talk about some statistics we did.
