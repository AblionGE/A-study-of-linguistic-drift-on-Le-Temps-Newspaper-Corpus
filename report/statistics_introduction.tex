We have articles from two newspapers covering years 1840 to 1998. The first step we did was to extract the 1 to 5-grams. Then we could work on those grams. The grams are separated by their sizes in different folders (1-grams, 2-grams, ...) and there is one file by year in those folders. The files contains entries in the form : gram <tabulation> count, where count is the number of times the gram appears in that year.

In the following sections, we are going to talk some statistics we did based on the obtained grams that could be considered as features to compute the linguitic drift.
