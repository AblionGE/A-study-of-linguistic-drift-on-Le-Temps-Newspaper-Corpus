\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Intuition help us think that, through time, language is changing because of the changes on the vocabulary but also in the words of this vocabulary is used.
Along with discoveries and civilization evolution, some words disappear and others emerge. Moreover, the 21\textsuperscript{st} is characterized by secondary source documents that influence us in our way of expressing ourselves. Thus, our study tries to define the features that could prove that there is a linguistic drift and to quantify the changes with a metric.
Our dataset is a French newspaper corpus from 1840 to 1998. We are provided with xml files of OCRized articles. The comparison is done between all pairs of years. The fact that there is less articles during first years is sometimes to be considered.
