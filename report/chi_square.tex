\subsection{Chi-Square Distance}

The \emph{Chi-Square} distance is often used in textual data analysis to find similarities between documents. It is very close to the euclidean distance (sum of squared differences between the elements) weighted by a term associated to the frequency of each word in the whole corpus.

\subsubsection{The formula}

In each subset $C_i$ of the corpus, we can denote $f_{i,j}$ the frequency of the word $w_j$. The distance is computed as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
 d(C_i,C_{i'}) = \sum_j \frac{1}{f_{.j}} (\frac{f_{i,j}}{f_{i.}} - \frac{f_{i',j}}{f_{i'.}})^2
\end{eqnarray}
where $f_{i.} = \sum_j f_{i,j}$ is the total number of words contained in $C_i$ and $f_{.j} = \sum_i f_{i,j}$ is the frequency of the word $w_j$ over the entire corpus.

The term $f_{i,j}$ can also be replaced by the TF-IDF term.

\subsubsection{Computations on the corpus}

We applied the \emph{Chi-Square} distance on the years contained in the corrected corpus, producing the following matrices:

\subsubsection{Analysis}

As we have a huge amount of articles for each year and that \emph{Chi-Square} is used to compare documents (with a relatively small amount of words compared to our case), the maximal distance achieved is very low as shown in figure \ref{chi2_1}. In order to observe something we reduced the scale of the colours in figure \ref{chi2_2}. This distance is definitively smoother than the basic one but it doesn't show any evolution through the years.

Figure \ref{chi2_tfidf} shows the results when the terms of the distance are weighted by the TF-IDF coefficients. The values look similar than without the weighting.
